# TurtleGraphics
A program that uses threading to draw patterns at the same time at a slow rate. Uploaded are some images it is in the process of drawing. To test it download the jar, run it, and once running hit the 1, 2 or 3 on the keyboard to start some turtles (numpad won't work). Hit delete to clear the screen.
